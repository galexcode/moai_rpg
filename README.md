# Moai RPG "Ancestors"#

My first Moai project.

## Installation ##

First [download Moai](http://getmoai.com/home/moai-sdk-download.html).

Once you've got Moai up and running, you're laughing.

To run the program:

* Clone this project anywhere on your computer
* Modify `run.sh` to point to your Moai config file
* In terminal type `./run.sh`

## How to play ##

* Click the screen to walk around.
* Attack enemies by walking into them.
* Pick up items by walking over them.
* If you're stationary, you will take damage if monsters attack!
